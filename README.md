# PCA
Spatial Principal Component Analysis (SPCA 1.1) with Matlab: By Tarik Benkaci & N. Dechemi (2020)
Note: The package calculates PCA using Correlation coefficient of Pearson, 
in addition (SPCA 1.1) there is clustering of observations by three methods: KNN, K-means and Hierarchical Clustering.
According to your language: french or english, if you want english version go to example_eng_2.m code and run it: then code displays: 
 “ basic characteristics of variables” of your data:
and calculations of pca : Correlation matrix (using c.pearson)   and computes eigenvectors and eigenvalues.  in second part: the code displays the principal results of pca.
the package displays Clustering of variables according three methods: KNN, K-means and Hierarchical clustering (HC)
